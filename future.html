      <h2>Context</h2>
    
      <p>In 2016, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) will celebrate its 50th anniversary.</p>
      <p>UNDP came into being in 1966 as a merger of two predecessors: the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance, and the United Nations Special Fund. </p>
      <p>Today, fifty years later, UNDP is as relevant as ever: connecting countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life. UNDP is the UN’s principal global development network and custodian of the UN Resident Coordinator system.</p>
      <p>To mark the occasion, UNDP is hosting a Ministerial Meeting on 24 February. Ministers from all UN Member States are invited.</p>
    
      <h2>Objective</h2>
    
      <p>The Ministerial Meeting will be an occasion for Member States to celebrate UNDP’s past, and chart a course for the future of global development.</p>
    
      <p>Participating Ministers will share their vision for how UNDP, over the coming decades, can best contribute to countries’ efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p>
    
      <h2>Agenda</h2>
    
      <p>The Ministerial Meeting will look ahead to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. </p>
    
      <p>Ministers will be given a platform for sharing with peers their vision for the successful implementation of Agenda 2030, and their views on UNDP’s role as a partner in achieving the SDGs.</p>
    
      <p>Ministers will participate in high-level debates on how to translate the ambitious global commitments into action and results. The agenda will include both plenary and smaller thematic sessions on the following themes:
    
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reducing Inequality:</strong> How to put in place measures that lead to inclusive growth, reduce income inequality and promote opportunity?</li>
          <li><strong>Protecting Climate and Planet:</strong> How to balance economic growth with our responsibility to protect the environment?</li>
          <li><strong>Ending Violence, Building Peace:</strong> How to ensure governance, peace and security are durable and benefit all members of society?</li>
          <li><strong>Managing Risk, Building Resilience:</strong> How to identify risks and take appropriate action to prepare for disasters and adapt to climate change?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Expected Outcome</h2>
    
      <p>The event is expected to generate a shared understanding of the greatest challenges and opportunities in carrying out Agenda 2030, and of UNDP’s role as a partner in implementing the SDGs. UNDP will use the conclusions and recommendations that emerge from the discussions to guide its future work. </p>
    
      <h2>Participation</h2>
    
      <p>Ministers from all UN Member States are invited. Participation by Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Planning, Development or Finance is expected.</p>
    
      <p>The event will be hosted by the UNDP Administrator. The UN Secretary-General is expected to take part. </p>
    
      <h2>Date and Venue</h2>
    
      <p>The Ministerial Meeting will take place on 24 February 2016, in the UN Trusteeship Council Chamber, in New York.</p>
    
      <h2>Other UNDP Celebratory Events in 2016 </h2>
    
      <p>The Ministerial Meeting will mark the launch of a series of sustainable development-themed events led by UNDP Country Offices to take place throughout the year.</p>
