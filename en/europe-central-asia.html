          <h2>EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA</h2>
          <p>UNDP's work in Europe and Central Asia covers 18 middle-income countries and territories from Croatia to Kyrgyzstan.  
    While countries in this region compare well with middle-income countries around the world, many of them face important hurdles. Across Europe and Central Asia, national economies have been growing slowly and are vulnerable to global commodity price fluctuations, aggravating labor market and other forms of social exclusion. Further, migration flows, natural disasters, environmental degradation and conflict are threatening to undo hard-won development gains.</p>
          <p>But there are reasons to be optimistic. More women and men are involved in decision-making than ever. The region’s youthful population holds the key to peace and creating modern and dynamic economies. Its vast renewable natural resources can also help promote more sustainable growth models.</p>
          <p>UNDP is working with its partners to help Europe and Central Asia attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These include a number of countries that are now playing a more active role in global development, with important lessons to share from their own experiences.</p>

        In hundreds of projects under UNDP's Action for Cooperation and Trust (ACT) programme, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots have forged habits of cooperation - improving the prospects for peaceful reconciliation on the long-divided island. While the ten-year programme ended in 2015, the real legacy and lasting impact of ACT will continue to be realized for decades to come. In this photo, the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus inaugurate the Limnitis/Yesilirmak crossing in October 2010.

        From 2007-2011, UNDP and the European Union supported a nationwide campaign encouraging citizens to surrender illegal weapons to the police, resulting in the collection of more than 87,000 illegal guns and explosives, 3.5 million pieces of ammunition, and 2.8 tons of explosive material. Collected weapons were destroyed or melted for reuse of metal.  At work in the country since 1996, UNDP today helps Croatia promote sustainable energy, protect the environment and advocate the full social inclusion of vulnerable groups.

        The Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986 caused long-term damage to the land and health of many people in the region, and prompted many residents to leave. In 2002, UNDP launched the Chernobyl Recovery and Disaster Programme (CRDP), which, among other things, helped the Government of Ukraine build community centers and kindergartens, such as this one in the Lugyny district, as young parents returned to the region and needed education for their children.

        Starting in 1998, in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia, UNDP and local partners hired long-term unemployed people, including many from the Roma minority, to restore culturally important buildings.  The program, called "Beautiful Sofia," expanded to more than 100 other towns in Bulgaria, restoring historic centres and creating tens of thousands of jobs.  The municipal building in Plovdiv, pictured here in 1998, was one of those restored.  The programme was then replicated in other countries, such as Serbia, Romania and Armenia.

        Since 1998, UNDP has worked to strengthen human security in Albania through programmes in the area of mine clearance, weapons collection etc. UNDP piloted the “Weapons in exchange for development” approach, which led to the voluntary surrender by communities of around 10.000 weapons.  In this photo, the UN Messenger for Peace Michael Douglas participated in a public ceremony of weapons destruction in Gramsh in October 1999 and called on communities to build a society free from violence.

UNDP worked with the country's Ministry of Veteran Affairs to ensure that victims of wartime rape and other sexual violence would be granted recognition, legal status, compensation and social and health support.  Since the law's passage, many have spoken of regaining a sense of purpose in life, or even just a new ability to smile.

Through a state-run national center in Tirana, UNDP has assisted the Government of Albania in providing domestic violence survivors nationwide with safe haven, counseling, vocational training, and legal services.  Also with UNDP's support, a decree to improve coordination among local government units was passed, leading to the creation in 2014 of an online system to track cases of domestic violence.

        More than 20 years ago, the conflict in Transnistria tore apart communities living on both sides of the Nistru River. Focused on building confidence in Moldova, UNDP, together with the European Union, launched a grant competition through which a newly-built medical centre became operational.  The centre was one of more than 150 facilities built through the programme, whch has revived economic activity and brought communities from across the river closer together.

        Aimed at reducing the country's high rate of unemployment at a time of global economic instability, UNDP and the Government of the Former Yuoslav Republic of Macedonia implemented the Self-Employment Programme. Over the past nine years, the programme has trained almost 10,000 individuals and created 7,721 new businesses (of which 70 percent have remained active), reducing the unemployment rate from over 37 percent in 2005 to 25.5 percent in the third quarter of 2015.

        UNDP ensures inclusive and effective democratic governance by fostering impartial spaces for dialogue and building institutions.  We also help create an enabling environment for all social partners, including civil society, to contribute towards national development.  In Armenia, through Kolba Lab, UNDP offers a platform for citizens to get involved in the development process, helping them define the problem they want to solve, and providing the space to incubate their ideas.

        Turkey and UNDP have been on a shared journey since the beginning of the organization, and even before. One of UNDP's predecessor organizations started work in Turkey in 1957, an office in Ankara was established in 1965, and UNDP was formally created in 1966. Together, UNDP and Turkey have carried out many projects in the economic and social fields in the country, and the partnership continues today. Pictured in this April 2015 photo is the launch of the UN Istanbul Regional Hub, which supports countries and territories in Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States where UNDP works.
