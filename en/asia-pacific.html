          <h2>ASIA-PACIFIC</h2>
          <p>UNDP has been working in Asia and the Pacific since the founding of the organization . We now support 36 countries and territories, through 24 offices in the region and the Bangkok Regional Hub.</p>
          <p>
     
    The Asia-Pacific region is home to some of the world’s largest and fastest growing economies, as well as some of its least developed countries; landlocked countries and Small Island Developing States; some of the most populous urban areas; two-thirds of the world’s working-age population; and rich biodiversity and natural resources.  </p>
          <p>
     
    While the region has made huge strides in alleviating poverty, it struggles to combat inequality, create decent jobs, especially for youth, and meet great risks from natural disasters and climate change.</p>
          <p>
     
    Working closely with governments in the region, UNDP has advanced employment and livelihoods; helped conserve biodiversity over more than 46 million hectares; supported innovative initiatives such as electronic waste disposal in China; and helped communities recover from and build resilience to disasters; such as the quake in Nepal, the cyclone in Vanuatu, and typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. </p>
          <p>
     
    We’re now assisting governments in planning, budgeting and implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. We also help governments fast-track those efforts through innovative projects on youth employment, technology transfer, climate adaptation and mitigation, and disaster preparedness.

        UNDP has worked in India in almost all areas of human development, from democratic governance to poverty eradication, to sustainable energy and environmental management.  Published in 2012 to commemorate a partnership of over four decades, this book illustrates how the people of India have collaborated with UNDP to achieve transformative results in development.

        UNDP officials visit a UNDP farm construction project in Feaung District, Vientiane Province as part of UNDP's work to help farmers modernize their agricultural practices. In this June 1984 photo, a local farmer demonstrates a new rice threshing machine received through the UNDP project. Today, UNDP supports Lao PDR's agriculture sector by helping improve its resilience to climate change.

        With UNDP’s assistance, the Government of Mongolia initiated an experimental microfinance programme in 1997 to support its less advantaged population. While UNDP's support concluded in 2001, nationally driven momentum and private resources have moved the sector forward. XacBank, once a UNDP beneficiary, is now an implementation partner.

        From 1993 to 2012, UNDP's primary programme of assistance to Myanmar was the Human Development Initiative (HDI), which covered 8,000 villages nationwide, reaching some five million women, men and children.  This book tells the stories of people impacted by HDI, which helped communities secure sustainable livelihoods and manage local development.  UNDP's work on sustainable development in Lao PDR through inclusive governance continues today.

        In the 1980's, UNDP, together with FAO, worked with the Philippine Government to develop production of fish and "carabao" buffaloes in order to raise the protein intake of people in areas where malnutrition was prevalent and to augment local farmers' incomes.  Today, UNDP, FAO, and other partners are working with the Philippines to address climate change risks in agriculture.
