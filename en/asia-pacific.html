          <h2>ASIA-PACIFIC</h2>
          <p>UNDP has been working in Asia and the Pacific since the founding of the organization . We now support 36 countries and territories, through 24 offices in the region and the Bangkok Regional Hub.</p>
          <p>
     
    The Asia-Pacific region is home to some of the world’s largest and fastest growing economies, as well as some of its least developed countries; landlocked countries and Small Island Developing States; some of the most populous urban areas; two-thirds of the world’s working-age population; and rich biodiversity and natural resources.  </p>
          <p>
     
    While the region has made huge strides in alleviating poverty, it struggles to combat inequality, create decent jobs, especially for youth, and meet great risks from natural disasters and climate change.</p>
          <p>
     
    Working closely with governments in the region, UNDP has advanced employment and livelihoods; helped conserve biodiversity over more than 46 million hectares; supported innovative initiatives such as electronic waste disposal in China; and helped communities recover from and build resilience to disasters; such as the quake in Nepal, the cyclone in Vanuatu, and typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. </p>
          <p>
     
    We’re now assisting governments in planning, budgeting and implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. We also help governments fast-track those efforts through innovative projects on youth employment, technology transfer, climate adaptation and mitigation, and disaster preparedness.

Today UNDP assists Bangladesh in reducing poverty, managing disaster risk, strengthening democratic goverance and promoting sustainable green growth. Most recently, UNDP, together with the EU, supported the Government's project establishing village courts that offer fast, low-cost, and local dispute resolution to millions of people in rural areas.

        Women make up almost half the world’s farmers. Yet smaller farms and less access to education and finance makes it more difficult for them to adopt new agriculture technologies. As part of its work through the Green Commodities Programme (GCP), UNDP is bringing together government, big business, small-scale farmers and other stakeholders to make farmers’ practices and livelihoods more sustainable in key agricultural commodities such as  palm oil, cocoa and coffee, in ten countries, including Indonesia. And success involves closing the gender gap.
