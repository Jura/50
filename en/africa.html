                <h2>AFRICA</h2>
                <p>UNDP has been present in Africa since the organization was created in 1966. Our Regional Bureau for Africa, which was established at the same time, today services 46 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa through 45 country offices, the Regional Hub in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and additional offices in Senegal and Kenya. </p>
                <p>
          
          Having put its lost decades behind, the continent has made significant strides socially, politically and economically since the turn of the 21st century. Rapid democratic transitions are leading to more responsive and accountable governments. The frequency of armed conflicts seems to be on a downward trend. Steady economic growth and macroeconomic stability have returned. Expanded social policies are improving health and education services, including those targeting women and girls. </p>
                <p>
          
          And yet the vision of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa faces challenges. As countries in Africa are operating at different speeds, the region’s major struggle is to ensure these advances benefit the many. Poverty rates remain stubbornly high, while progress on health, sanitation and food security have been slow and uneven. Women and youth in particular continue to face joblessness and limited opportunities for participation in politics and business. Climate change, natural and man-made disasters risk undoing years of hard-won development gains, and limited access to affordable and sustainable energy impedes productivity.</p>
                <p>
          
          In line with Agenda 2030, UNDP is supporting Africa’s transformation by enhancing inclusive and sustainable growth, widening political participation, and developing responsive institutions. We work with governments, businesses, communities and regional organizations, helping countries to develop capacity, share knowledge and mobilize funds for sustainable development.</p>

Aimed at reducing poverty especially among rural women, the installation of diesel-fueled engines has increased access to energy, freed up time spent on laborious tasks and created income-generating opportunities.

              With support from UNDP, Zimbabwe engaged in an historic process that culminated in a new Constitution promulgated in 2013.  It includes a comprehensive Bill of Rights covering civil, political, social and economic spheres. UNDP helped establish the constitutional basis for independent commissions on human rights, elections, and peace and reconciliation, thereby enhancing the rule of law and accountability in the country.

              In the early 1990s, before climate change caught popular attention, UNDP provided funding for research by an international team of scientists at <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" title="International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center">CIMMYT</span> in Mexico on how to breed resilient maize for farmers in drought-prone tropical areas. Several decades later, that scientific concept is now reality. In 2016 more than 2 million farmers are acquiring and growing drought-tolerant varieties in 13 countries of sub-Saharan Africa, including Tanzania.

Today, UNDP continues to support Eritrea by helping its agriculture sector increase its resilience and its capacity to adapt to climate change through water harvesting, soil erosion measures, community-based early warning systems, and other work.

              At work with the Gambia since 1975, UNDP has supported the country's efforts to reduce poverty, protect human rights, and promote gender equality.  Following the presidential pronouncement banning female genital mutilation or cutting (FGM/C), UNDP, together with other UN agencies, supported the development of an anti-FGM/C bill, which led to the passage of the 2015 Women’s Act Amendment criminalizing FGM/C.

              Present in the country since 1972, UNDP works with local communities to identify solutions to national challenges in development.  In 2015, we worked with the Governments of Cameroon and Japan, to help renew the Zamaï market, in Mokolo city, whose infracture was nearly non-existent prior to the refurbishment.  Its renewed facilities have boosted trade at the market, which serves both Cameroonians and Nigerians, including refugees from the nearby Minawao camp, home to 55,194 Nigerians seeking shelter from Boko Haram attacks.

               With over half the country vulnerable to droughts and a third to floods, disaster risk in Uganda is particularly high.  Without addressing the growing levels of disaster and climate risk, the Government estimates that 43 percent of the population could regress into poverty.  With support from UNDP, the country has embarked on an ambitious programme to support Ugandans by mapping and profiling hazards, as well as risks and vulnerabilities across the country's 112 districts.  With this and other efforts in place, Uganda will be in a much better position to make evidence-based development and investment decisions.

               Women make up almost half the world’s farmers. Yet smaller farms and less access to education and finance makes it more difficult for them to adopt new agriculture technologies. As part of its work through the Green Commodities Programme (GCP), UNDP is bringing together government, big business, small-scale farmers and other stakeholders to make farmers’ practices and livelihoods more sustainable in key agricultural commodities such as  palm oil, cocoa and coffee, in ten countries, including Ghana. And success involves closing the gender gap.
